New changes in measuRing V0.3:

1. The previous dependence: "zoo" is not required in this version.

2. A new dependence was added to the package: "png".

3. Three new functions have been implemented in this version:
  "colNarrows", "dataSegments", and "multiDetect" (see package
  documentation).

4. Titles and definitions of available functions were changed (see
  package documentation). Titles were shortened.

5. With the exception of "imageTogray", most of the available
   functions pass arguments to other required functions (see the
   implementation of ellipsis: ... in the functions).

6. With exception of function "imageTogray", required argument "image"
   not only can be a character but an array such as a gray matrix. In
   the function "imageTogray" such an argument can only be a character
   with the path of an image section.

7. Most of the available functions can be evaluated with the required
   argument "image" except the funtions "grayDarker" and
   "linearDetect" which require of precomputed smoothed grays from
   "graySmoothed".

8. Changes in function "grayDarker": name of the argument "data2" was
  changed by "smoothed"; a new logical, default argument "darker =
  TRUE" was implemented.

9. Changes in function "graySmoothed": the moving average in this
   function was replaced with a Hanning filter. Argument "gray" was
   changed by argument "image"; "ppi" is passed to "imageTogray"; a
   new logical, default argument "all = TRUE" was added.

10. Changes in function "imageTogray": besides the mentioned changes
   in the argument "image"; the logical, default "ppi = NULL" is
   passed to this function.

11. Changes in function "lagIngray": besides the changes with the
    argument "image"; a new logical, default argument "acf = FALSE" is
    implemented.

12. Changes in function "linearDetect": the name of the arguement
   "data2" was changed by "smoothed"; a new logical, default argument
   "darker = TRUE" is implemented.

13. Changes in function "plotSegments": besides the changes with the
    argument "image", argument "pixtypes" was avoided; "last.yr" and
    "origin" are passed to other functions (see "dataSegments" and
    "ringWidths"); three new arguments "marker = NULL", "col.marker =
    'red'", and "plot = TRUE" have been added; "marker" is implemented
    to add markers to the plots: narrow rings, decades, centuries, and
    millenia; the column numbers in gray matrix are now markers as
    well and are visible only when "marker" is integer.

14. Changes in function "pixelTypes": the name of such a function
    changed to "ringBorders"; argument "data2" was changed by argument
    "image"; arguments "boders" and "over" were avoided; the
    overriding of over-detected ring borders is now automatically
    developed by "linearDetect", so this argument is not necessary
    anymore; two new logical, default arguments were added: "auto.det
    = TRUE" and "darker = TRUE".

15. Changes in function "ringDetect": besides the changes in "image",
    other arguments are passed to required functions (see
    "plotSegments", "dataSegments", "ringWidths", and "ringBorders");
    "method = 'linear'" was changed to "auto.det = TRUE" and is passed
    to "ringBorders". Objects with outputs of this function can be
    updated with function update(). Output does not contain the gray
    matrix.

16. Changes in function "ringSelect": the character, argument "type"
   was changed by the logical, default argument "any.col = TRUE".
